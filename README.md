Creating Artificially Intelligent Agents in Minecraft using Project Malmo. This was created using Q-tables and Reinforcement Learning but i do discuss the possible use of Deep Q-Learning given more time which would most likely provide improved results.

There are copies of both my final deliverable and a poster submission which was presented to various lecturers and industry professionals.

The agent was tasked with exploring an arena to collect apples and avoid enemies only knowing the whereabouts of enemies in a 2 block radius around it. The agent was compared with various other agents based on the number of apples collected, time survived and a final score created using the rewards. 

I created various files to comparing with my agent through the task:
1. A lawnmower agent which would travel up and down the entire size of the arena methodically checking every space.
2. A random agent which would make random turns.
3. The Mob_Fun agent which was a modified version of an example file within Project Malmos files which would use Heuristics to attempt to make the best move to avoid enemies and collect apples.
